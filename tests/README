== RUNNING ==

In order to run the test suite you can either use the run_tests_lin.bash
script or run the ../aws_test.bash script

The run_test_lin.bash script runs all tests and computes assigment grade (100
points maximum):

	./run_tests_lin.bash

In order to run a specific test ... use the pass the test number (1 .. 35) to
the aws_test.bash script.

Tests use the static/ and dynamic/ folders. These folders are created and
removed using the "init" and "cleanup" arguments to run_tests_lin.bash.

== TESTS ==

Tests are basically unit tests.

Each test function follows the unit test patter: initialization, action,
evaluation.

Each test starts the server, creates a given context, checks for validity and
then terminates the server process.
